### Course Description
This studio course investigates the creative possibilities in programming, from interactivity to information visualization. Students explore interactive narratives and games, software art, simulations and emergent behaviors, and other code-based forms. Lectures, discussions, and demonstrations provide a conceptual, aesthetic and technical foundation in programming as a creative practice.

### Course Goals

-foundation in creative coding.
-projects spanning conceptual and creative ideas.
-interfacing of both hardware and software in creative practice.

__Key goals include:__

- Working knowledge of contemporary open source coding tools.
- Working knowledge of contemporary open hardware tools
- Working knowledge of contemporary artists and groups that shape the fields of interactive art and creative code.
- Working knowledge of intermediate linux/unix OS features (scripting, terminal, automation, etc)

### Course Values

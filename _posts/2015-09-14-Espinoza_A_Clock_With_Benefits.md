**Interactive line**
Line projected onto floor or wall that can track participants; can manipulate
line with shadows, i.e. move it, stretch it, bend it, etc; multiple states
to presence, including when no one is available

**Architectural generator**
http://www.continuumfashion.com/Ddress/

Use simple user-input (dragging mouse, drawing line, etc.) that automatically
creates architectural structures based on desired style

**Like/dislike app for art**
Continue working on app that helps user to distill aesthetic taste to concrete
characteristics by displaying artwork on the screen, and using a simple
swiping interface to determine whether or not the user likes/dislikes 
the artwork, then showing pieces that continues to refine what one's "taste"
is

**Interactive environment**
Two environments: one with a participant, who's image is projected as a
silhouette, then my own, at some distance away(perhaps another building), 
where I can see the participant's silhouette in real-time; I can manipulate
the image of the participant (stretching, bending, pushing, distorting, etc)
and these changes are reflected instantly in the space where the participant
is, who can see my changes in real-time

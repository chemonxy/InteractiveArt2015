**Walking clock:**
I am not quite sure if this is a useful concept but surely entertaining. I haven’t flushed out the concept out completely yet, but it’s a close that moves when an hour hits.
The clock concept is that it rolls and walks away from you slowly as time passes by. I am not sure if I want this on a track or not. But this would be a fun project to work on. When the user touches the walking ball. It gets confused and re-times it’s self… At times fast forwards or slows the timer.  

**Procrastination Bomb** 
An app that ruins your life when you don’t finish your work on time. 
Either:
Deletes photos, apps or something with in your phone. 
It sends emails or random irritating texts to random strangers and friends. 
I am not sure how the security issue lies with in IOS or Droid but this is something fun to tinker with. Since an app accessing other information doesn’t workout quite as right. I might have to have it linked to a PC or MAC. However this will function more like a virus than anything. 

**Rise and Shine**
A projection that changes with the time and the weather outside. 
Projected on to the ceiling and mimics the outside world.

**A interactive hologram glover set.** 
In EDM culture there is something called glovers. Their main focus is to create light shows in the tune with the music. Although this requires skills. I was wondering if it is possible to create something that has a sync feature to a large hologram prism, if not a projector. So you can be more captured with the real lights without the gloves interfering the illusion. 


**Extra: I wanted to ask you about this:** 
Art Connector. 
This is probably more of an ongoing thing… 
But I am interested in making this happen. In the long run... 
An algorithm app that finds art that is similar to the picture posted and pulls artists with the same style for recommendations to look at.

**Auto Javanese Gamelan**

Gamelan is a style of traditional Indonesian Music i’ve been peripherally interested in for years. a Gamelan ensemble consists mostly of percussive instruments: a kedang ( think congo drum turned sideways ) a large gong + some smaller gongs/bells &&  xylophone-like instruments. Gamelan music is very cyclical, with interlocking rhythms nested w/in other parent rhythms. diagrams of Gamelan patterns are often drawn as circles ( see image below ) but it might be more useful to think of them as interlocking ( or otherwise overlapped/linked ) circles. depending on whether the gongs && metal bars ( on the metallophone-like instruments ) are muted before playing the next note or allowed to ring you can get interesting phasing / harmonic sounds. I’m thinking of algorithmically laying out some of these patterns as well as the interlocking relationship of these patterns as my “clock with benefits”, the idea being that the piece could take any sample and recut/mix it into a generative ( as in constantly evolving along these rhythmic rules ) gamelan inspired composition.

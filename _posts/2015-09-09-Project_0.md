Can a computer be accurately described as a "clock with benefits" (see [What is Code For?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/))?

The title of your first work of creative code will be "A Clock with Benefits".

Based on your existing artistic practice and perspective, create a work of creative code that allows you to make sense of this title.  You may take it very literally (e.g. create a more beneficial clock) but it may be more interesting to engage the title poetically.

Ultimately, the goal is for you to engage technical concepts like loops, cycles, repetition, interaction, states, etc alongside engaging one person's description of the nature of the computer.

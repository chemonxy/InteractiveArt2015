**1. Structure iOS 3D scanner auto share app/website**

application / website: Structure scanner export application and web interface / web project to display / view scans, with later options to categorize and organize the scans and allow visitors to sort them. the application would allow a user to upload obj files from existing structure scanner app / SDK on ios and see them loaded up into a 3d space in the web browser that they can share with others. This example ( <https://sketchfab.com/models/e6b8e2b5c19945ee813504253a34c8c7?utm_source=oembed&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=e6b8e2b5c19945ee813504253a34c8c7>) - on sketchfab is ok but aesthetically i'm looking for something more stripped down and capable of showing many obj files at once.

**2. Improve resolution / range of Structure ios scanner.**

software/app: To build my own scanner using a kinect / structure, to try to improve the resolution  and get better results, either larger scanned areas, increasing the focal length, to scan from a drone in realtime for example, or to scan larger structures with better resolution results, than currently available

**3. Augmented Reality app for upcoming 3DP book**

software/app: Augmented Reality Application. For upcoming Sullivan book, i want to make an AR app to provide access to extra layers on content that cannot easily be “displayed” on the 3D printed or physical pages. This comes out of a long standing interest in embedding scannable symbols or trackers in 3d printed or digitally fabricated pieces - it would be awesome to figure out a way to do this in monochrome - so one color plastic extrusion, or to automatically generate a smaller icon that fits or is inlaid into the object - or that the object itself is a symbol / tracker / trigger for the AR app. i’m fascinated by the idea that the object is a physical form of url - and that this stream of info can be variable - and be updated over time.

**4. 3D printed Mold Making app**

mold making software / plugin for rhino. i need a piece of software that automates the mold making process, taking into account overhangs, draft, parting lines etc. in an ideal world the user drops an STL into the mold box area, and the program determines the number of parts needed and places the keys and parting lines. the program then offers ability to export the mold parts and STL or STEP for 3DP / CAM respectively.

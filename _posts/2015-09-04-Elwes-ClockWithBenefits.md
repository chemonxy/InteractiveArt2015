**1. Create a particle world that uses time values as a parameter**

A system that adds more particles per second, (perhaps divides itself into clouds/areas or changes a variable for minute/hour).

**2. Use diffusion reaction to create patterns**

A natural algorithm with is maze like complexity somewhat resembles clockwork. I would like to animate this process and see what outcomes can be achieved.

**3. Use ofxTimeline to create something working with and controlling time  **

Possibly as an extension of project 1 & 2, to graph the motion, or create multiple scenes.

**4. Create a recursive process that adds more complexity with time**

Each stem/recursion could represent seconds/minutes/hours. Could visually represent clockwork, or fractals/snowflake/trees or just an abstract form.

1. Bookkeeping!
    - Make sure you can access the class forum here: http://talk.olab.io/c/saic/ats-3135-interactive-art.  If you can't, make sure you have signed up for an account and sent me your username via email.  From this week forward, all class announcements will be posted on our private forum.  You are responsible for making sure that you get the announcements, so make sure you've got everything configured correctly.

2. Read!
    - Read: ofBook: [Graphics](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html)
        - Why? _You have to know how to draw!_
    - Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)
        - Why? _This gives an overview of the important concept of Object Oriented Programming. We'll be covering this in class._
    - Read: [Version Control with Git](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/version_control_with_git.html)
        - Why? _Git is a tool that you'll use all the time in this class and in your future lives as Creative Coders. It's by far the most popular way to share and manage code and should become a bit like breathing as you develop code._

3. Watch!
    - Watch at least one of these videos [https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos).
        - Why: _The presenters at [Eyeo Festival](http://eyeofestival.com/) and [INST-INT](http://inst-int.com/) are very influential in the field of Interactive Art / Creative Code.  Pay attention to them, but try not to be overwhelmed._

4. Project Proposal
    - Post four ideas for _Project 0: A Clock With Benefits_ on a blog post on our class.
    - To make a blog post, use the `2015-09-04-HelloWorld.md` as a template.  Duplicate the file, change the name and the metadata to match your project and `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, then pull request.
